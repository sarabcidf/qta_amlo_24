	abstract = {Abstract. The scientific debate about populism has been revitalised by the recent rise of extreme-right parties in Western Europe. Within the broad discussion about populism and its relationship with extreme-right, this article is confined to three topics: a conceptual, an epistemological and an empirical issue. First, taking a clear position in the ongoing definition struggle, populism is defined primarily as a specific political communication style. Populism is conceived of as a political style essentially displaying proximity of the people, while at the same time taking an anti-establishment stance and stressing the (ideal) homogeneity of the people by excluding specific population segments. Second, it is pointed out that defining populism as a style enables one to turn it into a useful concept that has too often remained vague and blurred. Third, drawing on an operational definition of populism, a comparative discourse analysis of the political party broadcasts of the Belgian parties is carried out. The quantitative analysis leads to a clear conclusion. In terms of the degree and the kinds of populism embraced by the six political parties under scrutiny, the extreme-right party Vlaams Blok behaves very differently from the other Belgian parties. Its messages are a copybook example of populism.},

The label is often attached to a certain party without any justification. Minimal definitions are alternatives but lack rigor. Classical content analyses provide more systematic measurements of populism but are extremely resource hungry. This article proposes an alternative, quantitative text analysis to measure the degree of populism among Belgian parties, drawing on both internally and externally oriented party literature. The results confirm that usual suspects such as the Vlaams Belang or Lijst Dedecker are the most populist of all parties under study. Populism turns out not to be an “either–or” concept, however, since we also identify a moderately populist party. It is furthermore demonstrated how populism can be attached to other ideologies, such as the radical right and (neo)liberalism. A cross‐validation of the proposed method with independent voter survey data confirms its validity. This article concludes that a quantitative text analysis might be a promising method to measure populism over time and space without the huge costs of hand coding.},

One obstacle to the study of populism from a global perspective is coming up with a measure of populism that is comparable across both space and time. In this paper, I clarify the theoretical concept of populism and introduce a novel computer-assisted supervised method combined with word embedding models for identifying populism in political texts. My method is highly generalizable and is not constrained by language. I demonstrate the usefulness of my method by measuring the degree of populism in English-language party manifestos and Chinese news articles. My method is able to identify populist texts with a high degree of accuracy in out-of-sample predictions, and therefore opens up new research opportunities to examine populism from a truly comparative perspective.},

Despite German-speaking countries offering a variety of populist parties, existing automated approaches are rarely applicable to German texts. Furthermore, they are not tailored to social media and often focus only on anti-elitism. I vastly improved existing dictionaries by analyzing populist ideology in its entirety, including people-centrism and the demand for people?s sovereignty. The article showed how known populist parties in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland spread these messages to a great extent on social media. Furthermore, I was able to highlight intra-party differences.

The data consists of over 200 tweets collected from his personal account between his inauguration on January 20, 2017 and his first address to Congress on February 28, 2017. The findings show how Trump uses an informal, direct, and provoking communication style to construct and reinforce the concept of a homogeneous people and a homeland threatened by the dangerous other. Moreover, Trump employs positive self-presentation and negative other-presentation to further his agenda via social media. This study demonstrates how his top-down use of Twitter may lead to the normalization of right-wing populist discourses, and thus aims to contribute to the understanding of right-wing populist discourse online.},

He addressed this group's concern by raising their moral status, that is, by (1) emphatically describing them as hard-working Americans who are victims of globalization; (2) voicing their concerns about ‘people above’ (professionals, the rich, and politicians); (3) drawing strong moral boundaries toward undocumented immigrants, refugees, and Muslims; (4) presenting African Americans and (legal) Hispanic Americans as workers who also deserve jobs; (5) stressing the role of working-class men as protectors of women and LGBTQ people.

With the objective of identifying the media behavior of the contents that were broadcasted about the morning conferences in digital press in Mexico (Excélsior, Milenio, La Jornada, El Universal, Aristegui Noticias and Animal Político), the news broadcasted by these informative sites during 22 working days comprised from June 20 to July 20, 2019 were monitored. The results present trends of 1,512 news items, their topics and the features of some headlines. The discussion questions that the populist discourse of the President is an input for the press, because when reporting on it "spectacularizes" the information generating a greater audience, superficial or amateur, a social attitude that puts our democracy at risk.},

	abstract = {Common wisdom suggests that populist politicians use a simple language. While scholars have provided vast anecdotal evidence of populists’ plain speech style, the empirical literature on populist communication offers very few and mixed comprehensive evaluations of the complexity of elected officials’ language. This paper relies on a novel populist dictionary and 78,855 utterances from the 17th Italian parliament – March 2013–July 2016 – to comprehensively study the link between populism and speech complexity. We argue that ideological and electoral considerations lead populist parties and politicians to employ a straightforward language. Moreover, we claim that party membership shapes the rhetoric of elected officials, leading members of populist parties to use a simpler language. Using computer-assisted text analytic techniques to inspect parliamentary speeches given by the members of nine Italian parties, we perform a difference-in-differences analysis of the influence of party switching on legislators’ behaviour. Our results suggest that populist ideology, electoral strategy, and party membership influence legislators’ language complexity. Our overarching conclusion is that language simplicity might be thought of as a feature of populist communication. This arguably has implications for the ability of populist actors to use a simple communication style to outperform their mainstream counterparts when competing for voters’ support.},
